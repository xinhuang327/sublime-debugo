# sublime-debugo
a sublime text 3 plugin for better debug experience with golang (using godebug)

### What does this Sublime Text plugin do?
Godebug is awesome tool for debugging go programs, but is feels inconvenient to manually add _ = "breakpoint" lines and update package names to instrument for godebug command. So I create a simple plugin to automate toggling breakpoints and adding instrument package paths to Sublime Text build file.

### Usage
You may change the code a little bit to fit your project (your own build file template etc.).
